SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ZMap is designed to run on GNU/Linux systems and can be built with
most recent versions of gcc. Currently, ZMap only supports 64-bit
systems. Running it requires at least 600 MB of free memory.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ZMAP

ZMap requires GMP, a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,
gengetopt, and libpcap. These packages can be installed on
Debian-based systems by running:

  sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev flex byacc

or on RHEL- and Fedora-based systems by running:

  sudo yum install gmp gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel flex byacc

Once these prerequisites have been installed, ZMap can be installed
 by running:

  cmake [-DWITH_REDIS=ON] [-DWITH_JSON=ON] [-DENABLE_DEVELOPMENT=ON] [-DENABLE_HARDENING=ON] ./
  make

followed by:

  sudo make install

Redis support is not enabled by default. If you are want to use ZMap
with Redis, you will first need to install Hiredis. Then run cmake with
"-DWITH_REDIS=ON".

JSON support is not enabled by default. If you are want to use ZMap
with JSON output, you will first need to install json-c. Then, run cmake with
"-DWITH_JSON=ON"
 
Installing json-c requires git and autotools to be available. For more
information on how to install json-c, please see http://github.com/json-c/json-c
